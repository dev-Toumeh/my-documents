This is actually a bug, however, there is a known solution.
First, edit your /etc/X11/Xresources/x11-common file:
sudo nano /etc/X11/Xresources/x11-common
Now, add this to or edit the file to include the following:
Xcursor.size: 22
Xcursor.theme: DMZ-Black
Known sizes are 8, 16, 22, 24, 32

Save the file and exit.

Log out and then log back in or restart your xsession to apply the changes.

## add app to dmenu 
### Dmenu only runs the executable in the system path. 
for example:
1- make sure the script is executable:
    sudo chmod a+x /home/user/.build/app/bin/app.sh
2- symlink it to /usr/bin.
    sudo ln -s /home/user/.build/app/bin/app.sh /usr/bin/app

## to change fonts
### add title font and bar font 
 - add folder in home directory ~/.fonts
 - go to i3 config file and add the font after font pango
    - for example "font pango:system San Francisco Display 8"
### config ttk fonts
 - install "sudo apt install lxappearance"

## suspend the computer if it was inactive 
### install xautolock
 sudo apt install xautolock
### add the following to i3config
- this part "xset dpms force off" will turn the display off
exec --no-startup-id xautolock -time 15 -locker 'systemctl suspend' -notify 600 -notifier 'i3lock | xset dpms force off' &

## To determine under which user the i3 configuration is running
- run "whoami" in terminal
