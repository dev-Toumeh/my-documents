## to fix the Mouse pointer size inconsistent

This is actually a bug, however, there is a known solution.

First, edit your /etc/X11/Xresources/x11-common file:

sudo nano /etc/X11/Xresources/x11-common
Now, add this to or edit the file to include the following:

Xcursor.size: 22
Xcursor.theme: DMZ-Black
Known sizes are 8, 16, 22, 24, 32

Save the file and exit.

Log out and then log back in or restart your xsession to apply the changes.

## add app to dmenu 

### Dmenu only runs the executable in the system path. 
for example:
1- make sure the script is executable:
    sudo chmod a+x /home/user/.build/app/bin/app.sh
2- symlink it to /usr/bin.
    sudo ln -s /home/user/.build/app/bin/app.sh /usr/bin/app
